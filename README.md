## The Challenge

We've got a grid of some of our first episodes here and we'd like to add some sorting to it.

The title and episode number columns already have a sort on them and they work great sorting by strings and by numbers.  What about the published date column?  How do we add sorting capabilities to that column so that it sorts dates properly?
